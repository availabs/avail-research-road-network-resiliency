Column Name,Data Type,Description
u,Integer64,Starting node identifier of the OSM road segment that forms the primary key part.
v,Integer64,Ending node identifier of the OSM road segment that forms the primary key part.
key,Integer64,"Key differentiating multiple edges between the same u and v nodes (typically 0), forming part of the primary key."
geom,LineString,The original geometry of the OSM road segment. Stored in EPSG:4326 (WGS 84).
